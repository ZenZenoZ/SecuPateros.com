        <h1>Signs of a Secure Website</h1>

        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Look for the S in HTTPS</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many URLs begin with “https” instead of http, this shows that they are secure because they have an SSL certificate. This protects information entered into the site, whereas websites with http are easily accessible, and are the information is more easily stolen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Check for a Website Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many websites have one and this demonstrates that this website is aware and actively complying with laws that provide security.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Find Their Contact Information</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the website provides contact information, such as an email or social media account, it does not guarantee security, but they demonstrate that the website can provide you with assistance if need be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson">
            <h2>Verify Their Trust Seal</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you see a sign like “verified” or “secure” it is likely a trust seal, which indicates the website has a security partner. This can also indicate that the website scans for malware. To make sure it is authentic if you click the badge then it should take you to a verification page.</p>

                <h2>Unusual Behavior</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If your device is suddenly slower, freezes or crashes more often, or shows unexpected error messages, it might be infected with malware.</p>
                <h2>Unwanted Ads or Redirects</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Frequent, pop-up ads or your browser redirecting to unfamiliar websites can be signs of adware or other types of malware.</p>
                <h2>Fake Antivirus Programs</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be wary of antivirus programs that appear out of nowhere, especially if they claim to have found issues on your device and ask for payment to fix them. These are often scareware programs.</p>
                <h2>Social Media Spam</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you notice fake posts or direct messages on your social media accounts that contain inflammatory statements or links, be cautious as these could be attempts to spread malware.</p>
                <h2>Malicious redirects</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you type in a URL and are redirected to another site especially one that looks suspicious – you have been affected by a malicious redirect. They are often used in conjunction with phishing kits.</p>
                <h2>Ransomware Threats</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ransomware will often encrypt your files and demand payment to restore access. Some types may also lock you out of your device entirely.</p>
                <h2>Disabled System Tools</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you suddenly can't access system tools like Task Manager or Registry Editor, it might be due to malware trying to hide its presence.</p>
                <h2>Silent Activity</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some malware tries to stay hidden, only becoming active when it receives instructions from a command and control server. This could be for activities like participating in a DDoS attack or stealing your personal information.</p>

                <h2>Backup your data</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regularly backup your data to ensure that you can quickly restore it in the event of a malware attack.</p>
                <h2>Use a web application firewall</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use a WAF to help protect your website from common web-based attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</p>
                <h2>Monitor your website's logs</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regularly review your website's logs to detect any unusual activity, such as failed login attempts or suspicious file modifications.</p>

                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Consider using security plugins that can help detect and prevent malware infections.</p>
                <h2>Be cautious with third-party code</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be careful when adding third-party code, such as JavaScript or iframes, to your website. Make sure that the code is from a reputable source and that it is regularly updated.</p>
                <h2>Educate yourself and your team</h2>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Regularly educate yourself and your team on the latest website security threats and best practices. This can help prevent accidental downloads of malware or other security incidents.</p>
